# Encounters

While out travelling or exploring, your crew may encounter rivals, hostiles, or events that obstruct or pose a risk. When this happens, the game is played over a number of rounds until the encounter is resolved. Every round has three phases: 

1. **Fast RCs Act**. Characters or creatures which have greater than human speed or agility take turns making actions.
2. **PCs Act**. Each of the PCs take turns making actions.
3. **Slow RCs Act**. Characters or creatures which have speed or agility comparable or slower than a human take turns making actions.

On a character’s turn they can make an action that can be reasonably achievable in roughly 10 seconds, such as attacking, using a device, sprinting for cover, or anything else deemed reasonable by the referee.

### Surprise
The side that initiated the encounter from a hidden position, or with the element of surprise, gets to act before the first round.

# Violent Encounters 
Violence is the failure to avoid a safer course of action. When an encounter gets violent, death is not far behind. Be cautious, smart, and work as a team.

## Close Combat
Characters using melee weapons can engage in close combat. To hit in close combat, the attacking and the defending characters make an opposed **END roll**. The winner deals their weapon’s damage to the loser. In case of a tie, the attacker wins. Melee weapons ignore energy shields.

## Ranged Combat
A character using a ranged weapon with line of sight of their target can engage in ranged combat. To hit in ranged combat, the attacking and the defending characters make an opposed roll. The **attacker rolls ADA**, while the **defender rolls END**. If the attacker wins they deal their weapon’s damage. In case of a tie, the attacker wins.

### Ammo

Some ranged weapons require Ammo. Ammo takes up 1 slot and has 3 uses. As long as you have Ammo in a ready slot, you need not worry about reloading. A character that uses Ammo during an encounter must mark a usage at the end of the encounter.

### Powered Weapons
A character that uses a powered weapon during an encounter must mark a usage on their power source at the end of the encounter.

## Tactics

### Reach
Characters using a long melee weapon only take 1 dmg if they lose a close combat roll against an opponent without a reach weapon. 

### Blast
Weapons or damage effects with blast will affect all targets in the area.

### Concealment
Characters that are fully or partially obscured from an attacker's sight gain a Buff to when defending against ranged attacks.

### Cover
Characters behind a physical barrier, that cannot be penetrated by an attack, cannot be hit by ranged attacks. 

### Suppression
Fully automatic weapons can suppress a target that is in cover. If the suppressed target takes an action that would cause them to be exposed, they must make an END roll to avoid taking damage from the weapon.

## Flourishes & Fumbles

If your attack roll is a **20** on the d20, the attack is a flourish. Flourishes allow your character to perform an extra non-damaging action as part of their normal attack. This action must affect the original target of the attack and can be anything with a similar impact as disarming, pushing, stunning, blinding, breaking gear, tripping, restraining, or anything else the Ref deems reasonable.

If you roll a **1** on the d20 during an attack, your character fumbles their attack and their weapon becomes worn. A worn weapon has its damage reduced to 1 until it is repaired. A worn weapon can be repaired by using a Supply, which takes roughly 10.  minutes. Rolling a fumble with an already worn weapon causes it to break.

## Hits, Armour, & Shields

If a character takes damage while wearing armour, the damage first reduces their Armour Points (AP). If no Armour Points remain, they take the remaining damage as Hits. Each Hit takes up an inventory slot. 2 AP can be restored by using Supply, which takes 1 turn. Some attacks or effects may deal Hits directly, ignoring a character’s armour.

If a character takes damage while wearing an energy shield, or similar protective barrier, the damage is first reduced by their Shield Points (SP), but is never reduced below 1. Some attacks or effects may ignore or deplete Shield Points. Shields require power and recharge 1 SP each round of an encounter. 

## Health Dice, Defeat, & Death

Each point of HD is a d6 that is rolled whenever the character is Hit. Hits may be gained as a result of a dangerous action or from combat. If the result of the HD roll is less than or equal to the Hits a character has accumulated, their luck runs out and they are defeated. If all the dice show the same value, they are killed instantly.

A defeated character is completely helpless, unable to succeed saves or make any meaningful actions, until they are stabilised with aid. If a defeated character takes any further Hits, they are dead.

Healing
Hits can be removed with appropriate medical attention, such as from a health professional. Stress can only be removed with stress relieving activities.
