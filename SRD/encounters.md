# Encounters

While out travelling or exploring, your crew may encounter rivals, hostiles, or events that obstruct them or pose a risk. When this happens, the game is played over a number of rounds until the encounter is resolved. Every round has three phases: 

1. **Fast RCs Act**. Characters or creatures which have greater than human speed or agility get to act.
2. **PCs Act**. Each of the PCs take turns making actions.
3. **Slow RCs Act**. Characters or creatures which have speed or agility comparable or slower than a human gets to act.

On a character’s turn, they may move and take an action. This action may be attacking, using a device, making a second move, or any other action deemed reasonable by the referee.

### Surprise
At the start of an encounter, the side that initiated the encounter from a hidden position, or with the element of surprise, gets to act before the first round.

## Encounter Range 

How characters can interact with each other depends on how close are far away they are. This is represented by 4 range bands.
1. **Touch Range**. Creatures in touch range can be touched, grabbed, hit, tackle, or otherwise be physically interacted with.
2. **Throw Range**. Creatures in throw range can be hit by a thrown object.
3. **Shout Range**. Creatures in shout range can be communicated with by shouting.
4. **Sight Range**. Creatures in sight range can be seen with the naked-eye in the distance.

# Violent Encounters 
Violence is the failure to avoid a safer course of action. When an encounter gets violent, death is not far behind. Be cautious, be smart, and work as a team.

## Close Combat
Characters using melee weapons in touch range can engage in close combat. To hit in close combat, the attacking and the defending characters make an opposed **END roll**. The winner deals their weapon’s damage to the opposition. In case of a tie, the attacker wins. Melee weapons ignore energy shields.

## Ranged Combat
A character using a ranged weapon with line of sight of their target can engage in ranged combat. To hit in ranged combat, the attacking and the defending characters make an opposed roll. The **attacker rolls ADA**, while the **defender rolls END**. If the attacker wins they deal their weapon’s damage. In case of a tie, the attacker wins.

### Ammo

Ammo is used by some ranged weapons, takes up 1 slot, and has 3 uses. As long as you have Ammo in a ready slot, you need not worry about reloading. A character that uses Ammo during an encounter must mark a usage at the end of the encounter.

### Powered Weapons
A character that uses a powered weapon during an encounter must mark a usage on their power source at the end of the encounter.

## Tactics

### Reach
Attackers using a long melee weapon, only take 1 dmg if they lose a close combat roll against a non-reach weapon wielding opponent. 

### Blast
Weapons or damage effects with blast will affect all other targets within the noted range of the primary target. 

*For example, if you are shooting a mercenary with a gun that has throw blast, it will hit all other targets within throw range of of that mercenary.*  

### Dual Wielding
If attacking with multiple weapons, choose which one to deal damage with.

### Concealment
A character is concealed when they are fully or partially obscured from an attacker's sight. Concealed targets of ranged attacks gain a Buff to attack rolls.

### Cover
Characters behind a physical barrier, that cannot be penetrated by an attack, cannot be hit by ranged attacks. If a character makes an action that causes them to peak out of cover they are considered to be concealed until their next turn.

### Suppression
Fully automatic weapons can suppress a target that is in cover. If the suppressed target takes an action that would cause them to be exposed, they must make an END save. If they fail, they take the attacker’s weapon damage. If the attacker is hit or interrupted before their next turn the suppression ends.

### Weapon Range
Every gun has an effective range. Attackers gain a Debuff for each range band outside of their weapon’s effective range.

## Flourishes & Fumbles

If a your attack roll is a **20** on the d20, the attack is a flourish. Flourishes allow your character to perform an extra action as part of their normal attack. This action must affect the original target of the attack and can be anything with a similar impact as disarming, pushing, stunning, blinding, breaking gear, tripping, restraining, or anything else the Ref deems plausible.

If you roll a **1** on the d20 during an attack, your PC fumbles their attack and they weapon becomes worn. A worn weapon has its damage reduced to 1 until it is repaired. Rolling a fumble with an already worn weapon causes it to break.

A worn weapon can be repaired by using a Supply, which takes 1 turn.

## Hits, Armour, & Shields

If a character takes damage while wearing armour, the damage first reduces their Armour Points (AP). If no Armour Points remain, they take the remaining damage as Hits. Each Hit takes up an inventory slot. 2 AP can be restored by using Supply, which takes 1 turn. Some attacks or effects may deal Hits directly, ignoring a character’s armour.

If a character takes damage while wearing an energy shield, or similar protective barrier, the damage is first reduced by their Shield Points (SP), but is never reduced below 1. Some attacks or effects may ignore or deplete Shield Points. Shields require power and recharge 1 SP each round of an encounter. 

## Health Dice, Defeat, & Death

Each point of HD is a d6 that is rolled whenever the character is Hit. Hits may be gained as a result of a dangerous action or from combat. If the result of the HD roll is less than or equal to the Hits a character has accumulated, their luck runs out and they are defeated. If all the dice show the same value, they are killed instantly.

A defeated character is completely helpless, unable to succeed saves or make any meaningful actions, until they are stabilised with aid. If a defeated character takes any further Hits, they are dead.

Healing
Hits can be removed with appropriate medical attention, such as from a health professional. Stress can only be removed with stress relieving activities.
