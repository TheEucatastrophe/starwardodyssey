# Actions

After the Ref has detailed the current situation, each player will have a chance to tell the Ref what their character is doing. On your turn, your character can do anything reasonably achievable with the time, resources, and skills they have. If there is no risk, uncertainty, or threat, your PC will perform the action as desired.

## Resist Rolls

If the consequences of an action would negatively affect your character, you can make a resist roll to avoid them.

To make a resist roll, roll a d20 and add the score from your relevant attribute. A result over 15 is a success, which means that your PC avoids the negative outcomes of their action.

If an action is trivial or a problem can be solved using purely narrative components, you need not roll.

### Opposed Rolls
When your characterâ€™s action is counteracted or resisted by another character, both sides make a resist roll. Instead of the rolling over 15, the side with the highest result wins. In the case of a tie, the PC wins. 

## Buffs & Debuffs 

If a PC has an advantage on an action, they gain a Buff. If they have a disadvantage, they gain Debuff. Buffs and Debuffs cancel each other out. When making a resist roll, roll a d6 for each Buff or Debuff. The highest Buff result adds to your roll. The highest Debuff result subtracts from your roll.

## Stress

Some actions and situations will cause a PC to receive Stress. Each instance of Stress takes up an inventory slot. If there are no empty slots available, you must drop an item to make space.

### Pushing a Character

Before making a resist roll, your character can gain a Stress to receive a Buff. You may choose to push your character multiple times on a single roll.
