# Actions

After the Ref has explained the current situation, each player will have a turn to tell the Ref what their character is doing. On your turn, your character can perform an action. An action is anything your character can reasonably achieve with the time, resources, and skills they have. If there is no risk, uncertainty, or threat, your PC will perform the action as desired.

## Resist Rolls

If the consequences of an action would negatively affect your PC in a meaningful way, you can make a resist roll to avoid the negative outcomes.

To make a resist roll, roll a d20 and add the score from your relevant attribute. A result over 15 is a success, which means that your PC avoids the negative outcomes of their action.

Failing a resist roll does not necessarily mean failing to perform an action, instead it means failing to avoid the direct consequences of that action.

If an action is trivial or a problem can be solved using purely narrative components, you need not roll.

### Opposed Rolls
When your PC’s action is counteracted or resisted by another character, both sides make a resist roll. Instead of the roll succeeding on a result over 15, the side with the highest result wins. In the case of a tie, the PC wins. 

## Buffs & Debuffs 

When a PC has an advantage or upper hand, they gain a Buff. When they suffer a setback or disadvantage, they gain a Debuff. Buffs and Debuffs cancel each other out. When making a resist roll, roll a d6 for each Buff or Debuff. The highest Buff result adds to your roll. The highest Debuff result subtracts from your roll.

## Stress

Some actions and situations will cause a PC to receive Stress. Each instance of Stress takes up an inventory slot. If there are no empty slots available, the PC’s HD is reduced to 0.

### Pushing a Character

Before making a resist roll, PCs can gain a Stress to receive a Buff on the roll. They may choose to push their character multiple times on a single roll.

## Scale of Actions

While playing the game, you will be switching back and forth between different timescales, depending on what you are doing. This changes the scale of your actions.

- **Encounters** play out in 10 second intervals, which is enough time for a character to move and perform an action such as activating a device, retrieving a packed item, or firing a weapon.
- **Exploration** plays out in 10 minute intervals, which is enough time for you to search a room, bypass a lock, or do any other significant activity while exploring a site.
- **Travel** plays out in a matter of hours or cycles (24 hours), which measures the time it takes to travel across a large area on foot, fly to the nearest planet, or jump to another star system.
