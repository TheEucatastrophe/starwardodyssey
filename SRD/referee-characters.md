# Referee Characters

Ref characters come in all different shapes and sizes. From tiny asteroid dwelling cave creatures to colossal interstellar space beasts, and everything else in between. All characters are made up of the same components.

- **Health Dice (HD)**. The amount of d6s the referee should roll when the RC is hit. RCs with 0 HD are defeated when they get hit.
- **Resistance**. A RC’s Endure, Adapt, and Resolve attributes distilled into one value.
- **Armour Points (AP)**. The amount of damage a character can take before it starts taking Hits.
- **Shield Points (SP)**. The amount of damage reduction a character has.
- **Speed**. Determines whether the character can act before or after the PCs during an encounter. 
- **Threats**. Attacks and/or special abilities the character might have.

## Reaction

When first encountering the crew, creatures and characters will react in a way that is appropriate for the current situation and their own goals. When uncertain about their reaction, roll 2d6 and consult the table below.

| 2d6 | Ref Character Reactions |
|------|------|
| 2 | **Aggressive**. They wish to do harm to the PCs. |
| 3 | **Hostile**. They will physically threaten the PCs.  |
| 4 | **Defensive**. They guard themselves against the PCs. |
| 5 | **Unfriendly**. They are aloof and unapproachable.|
| 6 | **Uncertain**. They act cautiously around the PCs. |
| 7 | **Neutral**. They are indifferent to the PCs. |
| 8 | **Mild**. They won’t bother the PCs. |
| 9 | **Approachable**. They are easy to talk to and will answer the PC’s questions. |
| 10 | **Opportunistic**. They will assist the PC if it also benefits them. |
| 11 | **Friendly**. They will assist the PCs, within reason, if asked.  |
| 12 | **Helpful**. They are enthusiastic and eager to assist the PCs.|

## Morale

When something manages to shock a Referee Character, such as they meet more resistance than expected, their leader is killed, they witness something horrific, etc, the referee should make a morale save against the RC's Resist score. If they fail they will flee, surrender, or attempt to parley.

## Freelancers

Freelancers are characters that can be hired to help the crew during their adventures. These are RCs that will act according to the terms of their contract.
A freelancer will usually cost ¤3 per HD. If they are hired to fight alongside the PC’s in combat, they also require half a share of whatever rewards the crew obtains.
To create a freelancer, set their HD and then roll 1d6 per HD, taking the highest result as their Resistance score. A freelancer starts with a weapon and another piece of gear relating to their area of expertise. 

### Robots
Robots are non-sentient AI machines that can be bought or loaned out to perform specific tasks. Each type will follow its very limited programming and won’t perform actions outside of its installed functions. A robot will only listen to commands from its owner and are not affected by morale.

## Elites

Any Ref character that is big, powerful, or important should be an elite RC. Elites work just like regular RCs, except that their Health Dice are split amongst their threats. An elite's threats are targeted separately. Players should state clearly what they are targeting. If unsure, make a roll to determine which threat is damaged. Roll a threat's HD when it takes Hits. If the result is less than or equal to the Hits the threat has accumulated, it is removed or disabled. Some threats may have an effect on the elite after they are removed, such as knocking them unconscious, causing an explosion, or killing them outright.
