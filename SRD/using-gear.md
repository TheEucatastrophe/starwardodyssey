# Using Gear

## Inventory Slots
Items are placed in your character’s inventory slots. Most items take up 1 slot, but heavy/bulky items take more and light/small items take none. You have 12 inventory slots.

### Ready Slots
6 slots are ready slots, which are easily accessible and can be quickly accessed or wielded. Anything that must be worn or held to be useful must be placed in these slots.

### Packed Slots
6 slots are packed slots. Items in packed slots take time to retrieve, especially when under pressure. 

## Usage

Some items can be used a limited number of times. Mark the item each time it is used. Once all uses are marked, the item is depleted or unusable.

## Power

Electronic gear requires power to function. As long as you have a usable power source in your inventory, your items will be powered.

## Supply

*Supply* is a 1 slot catch-all item representing basic gear, tools, and materials. At any time during the game, you may convert a *Supply* your character is carrying into a simple, commonly available item. The Ref determines which items can be acquired using Supply. Supply can also be used to repair armour and weapons.

### Supply Examples
Anything cheap, common, and simple, such as; rations, telescopic pole, thermal bedroll, glow markers, prybar, bandages, steel cable, canteen, hammer, basic clothes, etc.

### Non-supply Examples
Anything expensive, uncommon, or complex, such as; weapons, armour, ammo, electronics, auto-tent, battery pack, vehicles, fancy clothing, etc.

## Trade

The Cage is home to many cultures, nations, factions, species, and communities who all have their own way to buy and sell things. If you want to trade, you need to use the local systems.

### Hyperfuel Cells
Within interstellar communities, hyperfuel is always in high demand. It is the extra-dimensional fluid used to enable interstellar travel. 3 hyperfuel cells (¤) can be stored in 1 inventory slot. ¤1  is used to jump 1 lightyear away and is roughly equivalent to 10 standard gold slabs or 100 credits. 

Cost/value estimates are as follows:
1. **Negligible**. > ¤1
2. **Cheap**. +- ¤3
3. **Affordable**. +- ¤15
4. **Expensive**. +- ¤100
5. **Exorbitant**. +- ¤1k

Hyperfuel can be found flowing from spatial anomalies, leaking from ancient derelicts, or stored in alien megastructures.

## Weird Tech

Cutting-edge, experimental, or unexplainable devices are one of a kind wonders to behold. They are immediately recognisable as being odd, powerful, or almost  magical in nature, but the properties can only be discovered through use or careful experimentation. They attract the power hungry and are often fought after. You won't find them in any storefront, but they can be found in ancient derelicts, black-site research facilities, megacorp laboratories, alien vaults, etc.

### Recharge
Weird tech often has limited use, requiring the you to fulfill a recharge condition in order to use again.
