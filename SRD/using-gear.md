# Using Gear

## Inventory Slots
Items are placed in your characterâ€™s inventory slots. Most items take up 1 slot, but heavy/bulky items take more and light/small items take none. You have 12 inventory slots.

### Ready Slots
6 slots are ready slots, which are easily accessible and can be quickly accessed or wielded. Anything that must be worn or held to be useful must be placed in these slots.

### Packed Slots
6 slots are packed slots. Items in packed slots take time to retrieve, especially when under pressure. 

## Usage

Some items can be used a limited number of times. Mark the item each time it is used. Once all uses are marked, the item is depleted or unusable.

## Power

Electronic gear requires power to function. As long as you have a usable power source in your inventory, your items will be powered.

## Supply

*Supply* is a 1 slot catch-all item representing basic gear, tools, and materials. At any time during the game, you may convert a *Supply* your character is carrying into a simple, commonly available item. The Ref determines which items can be acquired using Supply. Supply can also be used to repair armour and weapons.
