# Using Gear

## Inventory Slots
Gear and items are placed in your character’s inventory slots. Most items take 1 inventory slot to carry. Bulky or heavy items may take 2 or more slots. Small or light items take up no slots. Characters have 6 ready slots and 6 packed slots.

### Ready Slots
Items in ready slots are easily accessible and can be quickly accessed or wielded. Anything that must be worn or held to be useful must be placed in these slots.

### Packed Slots
Items in packed slots are stowed away and take time to retrieve, especially when under pressure. 

## Usage

Some items can be used multiple times before they are depleted. Mark the item each time it is used, or when indicated. Once all uses are marked, remove the item from your inventory.

## Power

Electronic gear requires Power to function. As long as a character has a power source in their inventory, their items will be powered. Certain situations, such as travelling or exploring may cause you to mark one or more uses. Some power-hungry items may need their own power source to function. 

## Supply

Supply is an abstract item representing the basic gear your PC can bring with them, and takes up 1 slot.
At any time during the game, you may convert a Supply your character is carrying into any simple, commonly available item. The Ref determines which items can be acquired using Supply and which should be bought or acquired separately.
A Supply can also be used to repair armour and weapons. 

### Supply Examples
Anything cheap, common, and simple, such as; 3 days of rations, telescopic pole, thermal bedroll, glow markers, prybar, bandages, steel cable, canteen, etc.

### Non-supply Examples
Anything expensive, uncommon, or complex, such as; weapons, armour, ammo, electronics, auto-tent, battery pack, vehicles, fancy clothing, etc.

## Cargo

Anything too big or heavy for people to carry, such as containers full of raw materials, is designated as a cargo item. Just like inventory slots, cargo items take up cargo slots in a starship. Each module has a number of cargo slots equal to its HD. Roughly 10 inventory slots makes 1 cargo slot.

## Trade

The Cage is home to many cultures, nations, factions, species, and communities who all have their own way to buy and sell things. If you want to trade, you need to use the local systems.

### Hyperfuel Cells
Within interstellar communities, hyperfuel is always in high demand. It is the extra-dimensional fluid used to enable interstellar travel. 3 hyperfuel cells (¤) can be stored in 1 inventory slot. ¤1  is used to jump 1 lightyear away and is roughly equivalent to 10 standard gold slabs or 100 credits. 

Cost/value estimates are as follows:
1. **Negligible**. > ¤1
2. **Cheap**. +- ¤3
3. **Affordable**. +- ¤15
4. **Expensive**. +- ¤100
5. **Exorbitant**. +- ¤1k

Hyperfuel can be found flowing from spatial anomalies, leaking from ancient derelicts, or stored in alien megastructures.

## Weird Tech

Cutting-edge, experimental, or unexplainable devices are one of a kind wonders to behold. They are immediately recognisable as being odd, powerful, or almost  magical in nature, but the properties can only be discovered through use or careful experimentation. They attract the power hungry and are often fought after. They can be found in ancient derelicts, black-site research facilities, megacorp laboratories, alien vaults, etc.

### Recharge
They often have limited use, requiring the PCs to fulfill a recharge condition in order to use again.
