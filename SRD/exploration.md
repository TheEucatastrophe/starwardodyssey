# Exploration

The bulk of what the crew will be doing is exploring sites of intrigue, mystery, or danger. A site is any location that is broken up into connecting rooms or areas. 

Upon entering a new room, use the following procedure:
1. **Inform**. The Ref describes the obvious details and dangers of the space. Players should ask questions about the location.
2. **Act**. The players declare what they want their characters to do and the referee resolves each character’s actions simultaneously. 
3. **React**. If appropriate, the referee will roll on the exploration events table and the player get a chance to react to the result.

## Exploration Events

Each time an event is triggered, add 1d6 to a pool of dice and roll them. Compare the lowest result to the exploration events table.

The Ref must telegraph any and all danger and risk to the PCs and inform them when they are about to perform an action that will trigger an event roll.

**General Event Triggers:**
- **Linger** for too long in the same place.
- Move **carelessly** through an area.
- Create a **disturbance**.

Some locations may have more specific actions or situations which will trigger event rolls, such as triggering an alarm.

| 1d6 | Exploration Events |
|------|------|
| 1 | **Encounter**. Reset the event pool and roll on the location’s encounter table. |
| 2 | **Sign**. Roll on the location’s encounter table. The crew finds evidence of that encounter nearby. |
| 3 | **Shift**. Something about the location changes. Advance the location's shift track. |
| 4 | **Drain**. Mark a usage on all active power sources. |
| 5-6 | **All Clear**. Nothing of note occurs. Remove a die from the event pool. |

### Encounter Tables
Each exploration site has an associated encounter table that is rolled whenever an encounter event is triggered. Roll 2d6 whenever an encounter occurs. 

When an encoutner is resloved, cross out that entry. If a crossed out encounter is rolled again, take the next entry towards the nearest end of the table (i.e. 2 or 12).

Below is an example encounter table with guides the Ref can use when creating an explorable site. 

<table>
  <tr> <th>Example Encounters</th> <th>Challenge Guide</th> <th>Source Guide</th> <th>Type Guide</th> </tr>
  <tr> <td>2. </td> <td>Perilous</td> <td rowspan="3">Faction</td> <td>XXX</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>3. </td> <td rowspan="3">Dangerous</td> <td>XXX</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>4. </td> <td>XXX</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>5. </td> <td>External</td> <td>XXX</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>6. </td> <td rowspan="3">Risky</td> <td>Faction</td> <td>XXX</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>7. </td> <td>External</td> <td>XXX</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>8. </td> <td>Locale</td> <td>XXX</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>9. </td> <td rowspan="3">Dangerous</td> <td>External</td> <td>XXX</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>10. </td> <td rowspan="3">Locale</td> <td>XXX</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>11. </td> <td>XXX</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>12. </td> <td>Perilous</td> <td>XXX</td> </tr>
</table>

### Shift Tracks

Every adventure site will have at least 1 shift track. These show something important within the site progressing over time. Each time a shift is rolled, mark the next unmarked entry in the track. Along the track things will happen that will change a room, area, or the entire location. 

|  | Example Shift Track |
|------|------|
| 1  | The storm outside grows stronger, causing the facility's structure to squeel as it slowly warps. |
| 2  | Power is severed, plunging the facility into darkness.  |
| 3  | Exterior windows shatter, letting in the harsh winds and icy shards. |
| 4  | The ceiling over rooms 1,3, and 7 are ripped off. |
