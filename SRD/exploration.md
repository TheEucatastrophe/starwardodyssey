# Exploration

The bulk of what the crew will be doing is exploring sites of intrigue, mystery, or danger. A site is any location that is broken up into connecting rooms or areas. 

Upon entering a new room, use the following procedure:
1. **Inform**. The Ref describes the obvious details and dangers of the space. Players should ask questions about the location.
2. **Act**. The players declare what they want their characters to do and the referee resolves each character’s actions simultaneously. 
3. **React**. If appropriate, the referee will roll on the exploration events table and the player get a chance to react to the result.

## Exploration Events

Each time an event is triggered, add a d6 to a pool of dice and roll them all. Compare the lowest result to the exploration events table. The Ref should inform the PCs when they are about to perform an action that will trigger an event roll. 

**General Event Triggers:**
- **Linger** for too long in the same place.
- Move **carelessly** through an area.
- Enters a **new section** of the site.
- Create a **disturbance**.

Some locations may have other triggers specific to them.

| 1d6 | Exploration Events |
|------|------|
| 1 | **Encounter**. Reset the event pool to 0 and roll on the site’s encounter table. |
| 2 | **Sign**. Roll on the site’s encounter table. The crew finds evidence of that encounter nearby. |
| 3 | **Escalate**. Something about the site shifts. Advance on the site's escalation track. |
| 4 | **Drain**. Mark a usage on all active power sources. |
| 5-6 | **All Clear**. Nothing of note occurs. Remove a die from the event pool. |

### Encounter Tables
Each site has an associated encounter table that is rolled whenever an encounter event occurs. When an encoutner is resloved, cross out that entry. If a crossed out encounter is rolled again, take the next entry towards the nearest end of the table.

### Escalation Tracks

Each site will also have an associated escalation track, which shows something substantial within the site progressing over time. Each time the escalate event is rolled, take the next unmarked entry and mark it, describing changes to the site as indicated.
