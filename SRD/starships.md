# Your Starship

Your starship is your home and your ticket to explore the vast expanse. They arenâ€™t difficult to operate, as most folk in the galaxy know the basics. 
Attached to your PC's origin is a starting starship. Once everyone has created their characters, you must decide as a group which starship out of your origins you want to keep. That will be your crew's starship.

## Modules
Modules are the building blocks of every starship. They are the various systems, areas, components, and compartments that provide it with vital and unique functionality. Most modules need a member of the crew to operate them.

## Hull Dice
Each module has a HD value which represents its structural integrity. Like Health Dice, they are used to avoid serious damage whenever the module is hit. 
Starting starships have 5HD. 

## Power
A ship's power source generates power for all the other modules. The amount of power a module needs is equal to its HD. If the ship can't generate enough power, some modules will be left unpowered and non-functional.

## Upgrading the Ship
You can add or change modules of your starship during a sojourn.
