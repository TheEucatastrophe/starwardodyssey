# Characters

## Attributes

You will rely on three attributes to save your PC from harm, distress, or other negative outcomes.
- **Endure (END)** is used for rolls requiring physical fortitude, athleticism, or resilience.
- **Adapt (ADA)** is used for rolls requiring quick thinking, dexterity, or hand-eye coordination.
- **Resolve (RES)** is used for rolls requiring strength of will, mental fortitude, or a compelling presence.
For each of these, **roll 3d6** and record the **lowest die** result. Afterwards, any two attributes may be swapped around.

## Health Dice

You start with **1 HD** and may get more from your origin or during the course of the game.
Each time your character is harmed, these dice are rolled to determine if it is enough to defeat or kill them.

## Origins

Roll **1d100** on the origins table.
Each origin provides a number of starting items and further options to roll on, which may themselves provide unique items or abilities.
You also start with a **light melee weapon** and **2 Supplies**.

## Character Growth 

Between adventures, your PC can hone their skills during a sojourn, which is a temporary stay in a safe starport where the crew can go their separate ways and tend to their own affairs. At the end of a sojourn, all the PCs increase their HD by 1. Your PC cannot have more than 10 HD. When a PC with 10 HD goes on a sojourn they must retire.
