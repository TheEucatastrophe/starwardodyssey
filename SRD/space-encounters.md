# Space Encounters

Space encounters play out over a number of rounds, just like regular encounters, except that turn order is based on ship size. Crews within ships with fewer HD go before ones with more HD. In case of a tie, the PCs go first. Crews within a ship may act as they normally would in a regular encounter. 

## Starship Range

Just like for regular range, starships use range bands. They work mostly the same except that they represent a vast three-dimensional volume of space. Starships also have different functions that work at different ranges.
1. **Impact Range**. Objects in impact range are either colliding or docking.
2. **Visual Range**. Objects in visual range can be seen with the naked-eye and be fired upon with the ship’s guns.  
3. **Comms Range**. Objects in comms range can be identified, scanned, communicated with, and fired upon with torpedoes.
4. **Detection Range**. Objects in detection range have only their position, size, and trajectory known, but at some delay. Detecting objects beyond this range is too unreliable.

### Starship Movement

On their turn, a pilot can use an action to move the ship one range closer to a target, one range further from a target, or keep a target at the same range.

## Guns

A starship can fire its guns at an enemy ship that is within visual range.
To hit, the attacking gunner and the defending pilot make an opposed **ADA roll**. If the attacker wins they deal their gun’s damage. Stationary ships automatically fail any rolls to defend.

Smaller ships will gain a Buff for attacking and defending. 

## Torpedoes

If your starship has a torpedo bay, a character using it can fire a torpedo at an enemy ship within comms range. At the end of every round, the torpedo moves one range closer towards its target. If the torpedo enters impact range, it hits the target. 

Torpedoes ignore shields and use a starship's heat and signals to track it.

## Hits & Shields

When a ship is damaged, it affects one of its modules. Which module is hit should be determined by the fiction. For example, if an attack was made from the front, the helm module is most likely to be hit. If an attack was made from behind, the engine module will be hit. If unsure, make a roll to determine which module is damaged. 

If a ship has a shield module, damage is first reduced by its SP, but is never reduced below 1.

## Wrecked Modules

Each time a module is hit, roll its Hull Dice. If the result is less than or equal to the Hits it has accumulated, it gets Wrecked and any crew inside that module is immediately defeated. Wrecked modules lose all functionality until they are repaired.

If the result is greater than the Hits, the module experiences an emergency. 

### Emergencies
The amount rolled over the module’s Hits determines the type of emergency.  Emergencies are removed after appropriate action by the crew is made.

|||
|------|------| 
| 1 | **Compromised**. The next Hit the module takes will Wreck it. |
| 2 | **Breached**. All the breathable atmosphere is sucked out of the module. |
| 3 | **Burning**. All within the module take 1 Hit each round. The module is Wrecked after 3 rounds. |
| 4 | **Short Circuiting**. Using the module deals 1 Hit to the user. The module is burning (see below) after 3 rounds. |
| 5 | **Disconnected**. Power has been severed from the module, rendering it non-functional. |
| 6 | **System Reboot**. The system is overloaded and ceases to function for 1 round. |
| 7 | **Malfunctioning**. Any saves made using the module gain a Debuff. |
| 8 | **Cargo Destroyed**. A cargo item in the module is destroyed. |
| 9+ | **Close Call**. The module is violently shaken but otherwise unscathed. |  

## Repairs

Spending 3 cycles in a safe spaceport clears all emergencies, repairs all Wrecked modules, and removes all Hits. 10 Supply can be used to remove 2 Hits or repair a Wrecked module outside of a spaceport. This process takes 1 cycle.
