# World Travel
Occasionally the crew may need to make a journey across an area of a planet or moon without their starship.
Regions will be marked with a number of points of interest such as landmarks, settlements, or outposts. These points will be connected by paths indicating the duration of a journey in cycles.

## Travel Procedure
1. Information. The referee describes the crew’s current location, weather, terrain, and branching paths.  
2. Travel. The crew chooses a point to travel towards and the referee describes the journey.  
3. Event. The referee rolls for the travel event, describing what occurs along the journey. The crew makes actions to resolve the event..
4. Arrival. After the event is resolved, the crew reaches their destination, unless they choose to alter their route.

While overland travel is an important aspect of many adventures, it should not be the focus.  Keep it short and simple, punctuated by key moments of crew action.

##Travel Events
Roll a 1d6 for each hour or cycle of a journey. Compare the lowest result on the travel events table below. 

| 1d6 | Travel Events |
|------|------|
| 1 | **Encounter**. Roll on the region’s encounter table. |
| 2 | **Sighting**. Roll on the region’s encounter table. The crew finds evidence of that encounter nearby. |
| 3 | **Exhaust**. The journey takes a toll. Spend a cycle resting or each member of the crew gains a Stress. |
| 4 | **Drain**. Mark 1d3 usages on all active power sources. |
| 5 | **Shift**. Something changes along the journey. Roll on the region’s shift table. |
| 6 | **All Clear**. Nothing of note occurs. |
