# World Travel

Occasionally the crew may need to make a journey across an area of a planet or moon without their starship. Regions will be marked with a number of points of interest such as landmarks, settlements, or outposts. These points will be connected by paths indicating the duration of a journey in hours or cycles.

## Travel Procedure
1. **Information**. The referee describes the crew’s current location, weather, terrain, and branching paths.  
2. **Travel**. The crew chooses a point to travel towards and the referee describes the journey.  
3. **Event**. The referee rolls for the travel event, describing what occurs along the journey. The crew makes actions to resolve the event..
4. **Arrival**. After the event is resolved, the crew reaches their destination, unless they choose to alter their route.

While overland travel is an important aspect of many adventures, it should not be the focus.  Keep it short and simple, punctuated by key moments of crew action.

##Travel Events
Roll a 1d6 for each hour or cycle of a journey. Compare the lowest result on the travel events table below. 

| 1d6 | Travel Events |
|------|------|
| 1 | **Encounter**. Roll on the region’s encounter table. |
| 2 | **Sighting**. Roll on the region’s encounter table. The crew finds evidence of that encounter nearby. |
| 3 | **Attrition**. Every character loses 1 Supply for equipment maintenance and food consumption. Failure to do so adds a Stress. |
| 4 | **Drain**. Mark 1d3 usages on all active power sources. |
| 5-6 | **All Clear**. Nothing of note occurs. |

# Space Travel

Worlds, space stations, fleets, and other points of interests, are usually found orbiting a massive object such as a star. These are called star systems or just systems. A starship can travel to any known coordinates within their current system.

## Space Travel Procedure

1. **Information**. The referee describes the starship’s current state,  location, and nearby activity.  
2. **Travel**. The crew chooses a point to travel towards and the referee describes the journey.  
3. **Event**. The referee rolls for the travel event, describing what occurs along the journey. The crew makes actions to resolve the event.
4. **Arrival**. After the event is resolved, the crew reaches their destination, unless they choose to alter their route.

## Space Travel Events
Roll 1d6 for each hour or cycle of a journey. Compare the lowest result on the space travel events table below. 

| 1d6 | Travel Events |
|------|------|
| 1 | **Encounter**. Roll on the region’s encounter table. |
| 2 | **Detection**. Roll on the systems’s encounter table. The crew finds evidence of that encounter nearby. |
| 3 | **Emergency**. A random module is damaged. Roll for an emergency. |
| 4 | **Attrition**. Lose 1 Supply per starship HD for general maintenance and consumption. Failure to do so adds a Stress to all the crew. |
| 5-6 | **All Clear**. Nothing of note occurs. |

## Space Travel Duration
Travel time between any two points in a star system will fluctuate based on the relative positions of those points. Roll to get the base travel time and then subtract the ship’s speed.

1. **Orbital Point**. 2d6 hours to reach a location orbiting your current world.
2. **Inner System Point**. 1d6 cycles to reach a location close to the centre of the system.
3. **Outer System Point**. 2d6 cycles to reach a location near the edge of the system.

# Constellation Travel 

Space is divided into constellations, which are clusters of nearby star systems and other celestial objects. Constellations will be marked with a number of points of interest, such as star systems, black holes, obstacles, etc. These points will be connected by a line indicating the distance in light years (ly). 

If a starship has a jump drive, it can jump to any known coordinate within a constellation. Jump drives must spend a moment to spool up and make the necessary calculations before you can jump. A jump uses hyperfuel equal to the distance travelled.

The duration of a jump is a number of cycles equal to the jump distance. Whilst jumping, the ship is completely isolated from external influence and communications. 

A ship always arrives at the very edge of a star system, since jump drives do not work near high mass objects like stars. 

## Jump Obstacles

The path between two points might run through a cosmic obstacle of some kind. When this is the case, a jump can still be made, but at a risk.

- **Monitored**. Someone or something is watching this route and will be alerted to your presence.
- **Minefield**. 1-in-6 chance of the ship taking 3 Hits to a random module.
- **Nova Scar**. 1-in-6 chance of your jump drive being Wrecked upon arrival.
- **Debris Field**. 1d6 random modules will be malfunctioning upon arrival.
- **Nebula**. 1-in-6 chance of your reactor being Wrecked upon arrival.
- **Cosmic** Radiation. Everyone on the ship gains 1d6 Stress.
- **Rift**. Reduces travel time by half.
- **Void**. 1-in-6 chance to be trapped inside a small pocket of Deep Space.

## Deep Space

Between constellations are vast spans of mostly nothing called deep space. This is the domain of the hidden, unknown, and strange.  It is incredibly difficult to traverse across Deep Space, even with a jump drive. Those that find themselves stranded in deep space have two courses of action available to them; activate a distress beacon or try to blind jump out of there.

### Starbridges
To travel to other constellations, a ship can dock in a starbridge. These are colossal liners with jump drives and computers powerful enough to navigate safely across the vast distances of Deep Space. 

### Distress Beacon
By activating a ship’s interstellar distress beacon, all nearby constellations will hear the call for help. Roll 1d6 each cycle to see who answers.

| 1d6 | Distress Beacon Events |
|------|------|
| 1 | **Encounter**. Roll on the Deep Space encounter table. |
| 2 | **Drain**. Lose 1 Supply per starship HD for general maintenance, consumption, and usage. Failure to do so adds a Stress to all the crew. |
| 3 | **Scavs**. Raiders, pirates, brigands, or whatever you call them, come for your ship. |
| 4 | **Hyperwake**. A passing starbridge creates a rift in space that you can use to jump to safety.|
| 5 | **Assistance**. A crew of fellow wanderers arrives to help. |
| 6 | **Intervention**. A strange cosmic force hurls the ship to a nearby system. |

### Blind Jump
In deep space, the jump drive cannot find any routes to known locations. A blind jump has a small chance of escaping deep space but uses 1d6 hyperfuel and takes as many cycles. Roll 1d6 to see where the ship ends up.

| 1d6 | Blind Jump Events |
|------|------|
| 1 | **More Deep Space**. You arrive elsewhere in Deep Space. |
| 2 | **Distant Constellation**. You arrive in a far away constellation. |
| 3 | **Megastructure**. You arrive near a huge ancient structure in deep space.|
| 4 | **Rogue Planet**. You arrive near an orphaned planet, drifting alone in deep space.|
| 5 | **Stranded Star**. You arrive in a star system stranded in deep space.|
| 6 | **Escape**. You escape deep space and arrive in a nearby system. |
