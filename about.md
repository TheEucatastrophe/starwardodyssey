What is Starward Odyssey?

You will travel across an area of the universe called the Known Galaxy, shortened to KG, but commonly referred to as the Cage. It is a collection of interconnected constellations filled with different civilisations, factions, species, and adventures. What lies beyond is anyoneâ€™s guess. Every game of Starward Odyssey starts with four established truths about the setting. The finer details of these truths, and everything else beyond them, is for you and your table to invent or discover.
A good rule of thumb to have is that if it didn't happen at the table, then it isn't yet true.

Abundant Humanity
The galaxy is filled with many strange and unique life forms, but humans make up the vast majority of sapient life. Due to their adaptability and drive to explore, they have spread farther and wider than any other species across the Cage.

Subsistence Existence
It turns out that managing interstellar empires across multiple star systems, let alone multiple constellations, is incredibly difficult. Despite whomever may be governing them, most folk have learned to take care of themselves; generating their own power, growing their own food, and defending themselves.

Low-Tech Revolution
The exponential advancement of technology has all but met its end. The technical debt of centuries of so-called innovation caused the widespread failure of various systems. Most people now rely on simpler tech, trusting things they can build, operate, or maintain themselves.

Bygone Remnants
For millions of years, transgalactic civilisations appeared to have ruled the universe. All of them building on top of whoever came before them. Today, they are long dead and gone. The nature of their disappearances remain a mystery, but they left behind many derelict mega-structures, crumbling ruins, and stellar battlefields filled with wondrous, often reality-defying, objects and devices.
